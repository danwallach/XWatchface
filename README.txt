This is a very simple Android Wear watchface based on the example watchface
apps distributed by Google.

What's useful and interesting is that it shows you how listen to broadcasts
from a stopwatch and timer and render them. You can pick up
XWatchfaceReceiver.java, drop it in your own code, tweak your manifest.xml
appropriately, and you'll have everything you need to build stopwatch and
timers into your own watch.
